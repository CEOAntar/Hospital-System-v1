🚀 Hospital Management System in C++ 🚀

Welcome to the Hospital Management System project! This system efficiently handles patient queues based on specialization and urgency, ensuring a smooth and organized process.

🔑 Key Features
- 🩺 Specialization-Based Queues: Manages up to 20 different specializations.
- ⚡ Urgency Handling: Prioritizes urgent patients seamlessly.
- 🔄 Dynamic Queue Management: Efficiently adds and removes patients from the queue.
- 🖥️ User-Friendly Interface: Simple menu-driven interaction.

📚 What I Learned
- 📊 Data Structures: Implementing arrays for queue management.
- 🧠 Algorithm Design: Creating efficient algorithms for shifting elements.
- 🛠️ Problem-Solving: Tackling real-world scenarios in healthcare management.

💡 Key Takeaways
- ⚙️ Efficiency: Importance of optimizing data handling in critical systems.
- 👥 User Experience: Designing intuitive interfaces for non-technical users.
- 📈 Scalability: Building systems that can handle varying loads and requirements.

🎓 About the Project
As a Computer Science student still learning the basics, this project has been incredibly valuable. It is the first project from Dr. Mostafa Saad's course on Udemy for the basics of C++. His course has been an amazing resource, providing clear explanations and practical examples that have greatly enhanced my understanding. Thank you, Dr. Mostafa, for your awesome course and guidance!
